# Neural-Network-for-Water-quality-analysis
Component 1 — Water quality analysis: 
This component uses CEFAS’ 2021 data on biotoxins and phytoplantkon (see https://
www.cefas.co.uk/data-and-publications/habs/england-and-wales-biotoxins-and-
phytoplankton-results-2021/) to find patterns of  higher or lower concentration of  either (or 
both) according to features provided. You should read the data into a program (second tab on 
phytoplankton), clean it and then train a multi-layer feed-forward neural network to predict 
from a set of  input features whether the phytoplankton level detected is above the threshold 
specified (see end of  file). You will need to make a range of  decisions in your analysis on data 
cleaning, network architecture and evaluation setup.  
You should answer the following questions:  
• Specify the accuracy you achieved across 3 architectural modifications (e.g. different 
numbers of  layers, different hyperparameters, etc.) 
• Why do you think your accuracy is not higher / lower? 
DATA ANALYSIS AND VISUALISATION  1
• What effect does the optimisation function have on network performance? 
• What happens if  you include more than 4 (hidden) layers? 
• What is the effect of  the data size on your accuracy? 
Generate and include in your your report the most suitable graphical plot of  the data
